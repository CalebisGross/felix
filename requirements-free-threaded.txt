# Felix Framework - Python 3.14t Free-Threaded Build Requirements
#
# This file specifies dependencies optimized for Python 3.14's free-threaded build,
# which runs without the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for true parallelism.
#
# Installation:
#   python3.14t -m venv .venv_free
#   source .venv_free/bin/activate
#   pip install -r requirements-free-threaded.txt
#
# Benefits:
# - 4-8x speedup for CPU-bound parallel operations (embeddings, graph building)
# - True parallel execution for multi-agent processing
# - ~5-10% single-threaded overhead, ~15-20% more memory usage

# Core dependencies with free-threaded wheel support
numpy>=1.26.0          # Free-threaded wheels available
scipy>=1.13.0          # Aligned with numpy for free-threading
lxml>=5.0.0            # Free-threaded build support
orjson>=3.10.0         # Rust-based JSON with free-threaded support

# Include all base requirements
