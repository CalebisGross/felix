# Felix Framework Index

## Overview

### 🔒 The ONLY Multi-Agent Framework for Air-Gapped Environments

**Felix works where LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen can't**: completely isolated, classified networks with **zero external dependencies**.

The Felix Framework is a **production-ready** Python-based multi-agent AI system designed to leverage helical geometry for agent progression and adaptation. It enables dynamic, scalable AI interactions by modeling agent behaviors and communications along helical structures, allowing for continuous evolution and optimization of AI tasks. The framework integrates local LLM clients, persistent memory systems, autonomous knowledge brain for document learning, self-improvement capabilities, and modular pipelines to support complex, adaptive workflows in multi-agent environments.

At its core, Felix employs a hub-spoke communication model combined with helical progression to facilitate agent spawning, role specialization, and task execution. The autonomous knowledge brain system extends this architecture by enabling document ingestion, agentic comprehension, knowledge graph construction, and semantic retrieval with meta-learning. The self-improvement architecture adds feedback loops, meta-cognition, concept consistency tracking, and contextual relevance filtering to enable continuous learning and adaptation. This architecture promotes resilience and efficiency in handling diverse AI challenges, from prompt optimization to knowledge compression and continuous learning from documents. By incorporating token budgeting, context-aware memory, and 3-tier embeddings, the system ensures sustainable performance across varying computational constraints.

Felix is structured around key modules that handle agents, communication, core geometry, LLM integration, memory management, knowledge brain, self-improvement, and pipeline processing. This modular design allows for flexible deployment and extension, making it suitable for applications requiring autonomous agent coordination, adaptive learning, and continuous knowledge acquisition with self-improvement capabilities.

## Core Architecture Benefits and Use Cases

### Helical Progression for Adaptive Behavior (20% Improvement)
Helical geometry enables agents to evolve continuously along spiral paths, improving workload distribution and adaptability in dynamic environments like real-time strategy games or adaptive tutoring systems.

### Hub-Spoke Communication for Resource Efficiency (15% Improvement)
The hub-spoke model with O(N) complexity enables efficient resource sharing compared to O(N²) mesh networks, applicable to distributed computing tasks such as load balancing in cloud services or collaborative problem-solving in research simulations.

### Memory Compression for Low Latency (25% Improvement)
Context compression and knowledge stores minimize data retrieval times, ideal for high-throughput applications like automated content generation or real-time analytics in financial trading.

Example applications include autonomous drone swarms for environmental monitoring, personalized AI assistants in education, and scalable chatbots for customer service.

## Dependencies and Setup

Felix requires Python 3.8+ and the following key dependencies (install via pip in the provided .venv virtual environment):
- `openai` or similar for LLM integrations
- `httpx` for async HTTP requests
- `numpy` and `scipy` for geometric computations
- `ddgs` for DuckDuckGo search functionality
- `beautifulsoup4` and `lxml` for web page parsing
- `sqlite3` for memory persistence (typically included with Python)
- `asyncio` for asynchronous agent operations (typically included with Python)
- `tkinter` for GUI (typically included with Python)

Optional dependencies for Knowledge Brain system:
- `PyPDF2` for PDF document reading (system works without it, falls back to text extraction)
- `watchdog` for file system monitoring (daemon can still run batch/refinement modes without it)

To set up: Activate the .venv environment (`source .venv/bin/activate` on Linux) and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai httpx numpy scipy ddgs beautifulsoup4 lxml
# Optional for Knowledge Brain:
pip install PyPDF2 watchdog
```

## Interactions and Workflow

Agents spawn dynamically via the core helix geometry, communicating through the central post with phase-based awareness and peer discovery. LLM agents optimize prompts, manage tokens, and leverage web search for real-time information gathering. Memory modules compress and store knowledge, while workflow history tracks complete execution records with searchable metadata.

The workflow system integrates web search capabilities, allowing agents to augment their knowledge with current information from DuckDuckGo or SearxNG. Results are cached per-task and filtered by domain to ensure quality. Pipelines process tasks linearly or via chunking, with synthesis results formatted as professional markdown reports including agent metrics and performance summaries.

The autonomous knowledge brain extends Felix's capabilities by continuously learning from documents. The system monitors watch directories for new documents, uses agentic comprehension (Research, Analysis, Critic agents) to understand content, builds a knowledge graph with bidirectional relationships, and makes knowledge retrievable via 3-tier embeddings (LM Studio → TF-IDF → FTS5). Meta-learning tracks which knowledge proves useful for which workflows, boosting retrieval relevance over time. The daemon runs indefinitely with concurrent batch processing, hourly refinement, and optional file watching, requiring zero external dependencies through intelligent fallback architecture.

The GUI provides interactive control with dark/light themes, allowing users to monitor workflows, browse history, manage memory, spawn agents, control the knowledge brain daemon, and view learned concepts. All workflow executions are persisted with comprehensive metadata for later analysis and retrieval. This interconnected workflow ensures scalable, adaptive AI behavior with continuous learning and optimization across all modules.
