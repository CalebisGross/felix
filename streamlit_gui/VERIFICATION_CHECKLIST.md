```
- Pre-flight check: All ✅ (App starts without errors, no import errors, browser opens to main page, sidebar visible with 4 pages)
- Helix 3D visualization renders ✅ (renders correctly at 864x600px)
- Export buttons ✅ (visible and working)
- Info boxes ✅ (workflow results tab, reports tab)
- No errors ✅ (no Python/JS errors, no failed requests, clean logs)
- Charts render ✅ (if data available)
```

### What's Broken ❌
```
- Tooltips ❌ (not functioning across all pages)
- Badges ❌ (present but hidden/not visible on Configuration and Testing pages)
- Dropdowns ❌ (not working on Configuration page, not found on Testing page)
- Mode selector ❌ (radio buttons not found on Benchmarking page)
- Metrics display ❌ (showing 0 or not displaying numbers)
- View different configs ❌ (content doesn't update)
```

### What's Confusing ⚠️
```
- Encoding issues ⚠️ (special characters in workflow results and reports tabs)
- Partial implementations ⚠️ (Benchmarking page loads but interactions fail due to selector mismatches)
- Checkboxes tooltips ⚠️ (not found on Testing page)
```

### Additional Feedback
```
Suggest fixing selectors for Streamlit components, implement missing metrics/tooltips, ensure badge visibility.
