## Summary
Integrates main branch features into Streamlit GUI: rebuilt benchmarking with new test suite, added workflow history browser with prominent output display, fixed configuration parameters, and cleaned up code quality per feedback.

## Changes

**Benchmarking System (Fixed Critical Issue)**
- Rebuilt `real_benchmark_runner.py` to use `tests/run_hypothesis_validation.py` instead of deleted `exp/benchmark_felix.py`
- Updated `4_Benchmarking.py` to run real hypothesis validation tests (H1: 20%, H2: 15%, H3: 25% targets)
- Added test configuration UI (hypothesis selector, iterations, real LLM toggle)
- Display results with metrics, box plots, and JSON export

**Workflow History Browser (New Feature)**
- Created `workflow_history_viewer.py` component with search, filter, and detailed views
- Updated `db_reader.py` with workflow_history database support (3 new methods)
- Added workflow history tab to Dashboard
- **Prominently displays final synthesis output** (300px text area) with copy functionality
- Added output preview column to workflow list
- Analytics charts (confidence trend, token usage, processing time)

**Configuration Display (Fixed Issue)**
- Fixed broken config file references in `2_Configuration.py`
- Added 8+ missing parameters (temperature ranges, compression settings, web search config, feature toggles)
- Organized into 6 sections with `st.metric()` displays and help text
- Graceful fallback to defaults when config files missing

**Code Quality Cleanup**
- Reduced all file headers to 1-2 lines (removed verbose docstrings)
- Cleaned up 6 files per Phase 1.5 guidelines
- Removed 1,070 lines of outdated/simulated code
- Added 461 lines of clean, functional code

## Addresses PR #2 Feedback
- âœ… Fixed outdated/non-working components (benchmarking with deleted files)
- âœ… Removed legacy module references (exp/ â†’ tests/)
- âœ… Fixed configuration display (broken links, missing parameters)
- âœ… Added final output display (synthesis text prominent, 300px height)
- âœ… Removed AI slop (concise docstrings, professional code)

## Testing
- [ ] Benchmarking page runs real hypothesis validation tests
- [ ] Workflow history displays with prominent synthesis output
- [ ] Configuration page shows all parameters (helix, agents, LLM, memory, web search)
- [ ] All operations are read-only (no database writes)
- [ ] No broken imports or file paths

## Files Modified
- `streamlit_gui/backend/real_benchmark_runner.py` (rewrite)
- `streamlit_gui/backend/db_reader.py` (enhanced)
- `streamlit_gui/pages/4_Benchmarking.py` (rebuild)
- `streamlit_gui/pages/1_Dashboard.py` (added tab)
- `streamlit_gui/pages/2_Configuration.py` (fixed params)
- `streamlit_gui/components/workflow_history_viewer.py` (NEW)
