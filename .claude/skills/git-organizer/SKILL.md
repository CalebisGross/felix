# Git Organizer Skill

You are a git workflow automation expert. Your task is to properly organize all new files, stage changes, create meaningful commit messages, and push changes to the remote repository.

## Workflow Steps

Follow these steps in order:

### 1. ANALYZE CURRENT STATE

First, gather comprehensive information about the repository state:

```bash
# Check current branch and remote status
git status

# Get detailed list of changes
git status --porcelain

# Check if we're on main/master (warn if so)
git branch --show-current

# Get recent commit history to understand commit message style
git log --oneline -10

# Show detailed diffs for modified files
git diff

# Show untracked files content if they're small
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Analyze the output to understand:
- What files have changed (modified, new, deleted)
- What type of changes (code, config, docs, tests)
- Current branch name
- Commit message conventions used in this repo

### 2. ORGANIZE & CATEGORIZE CHANGES

Group the changes into logical categories:

**Categories to consider:**
- **Features**: New functionality or enhancements
- **Fixes**: Bug fixes or corrections
- **Refactoring**: Code improvements without behavior changes
- **Documentation**: README, comments, docs
- **Configuration**: Config files, dependencies
- **Tests**: Test files and test-related changes
- **Build/CI**: Build scripts, CI configuration

**File grouping rules:**
- Group related files together (e.g., a component + its test + its styles)
- Separate unrelated changes into different commits
- Don't mix feature work with refactoring
- Keep config/dependency updates separate

**Safety checks:**
- **NEVER** stage sensitive files: `.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, API keys
- **RESPECT** `.gitignore` patterns
- **WARN** about large files (>1MB)
- **CHECK** for debug code (`console.log`, `debugger`, commented code)

### 3. CREATE COMMIT PLAN

For each logical group of files, create a commit plan:

**Commit Message Format:**
Follow Conventional Commits format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (deps, config)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes

**Example commits:**
```
feat(agents): Add specialized git operation agents

Implemented FileAnalyzerAgent, GitStagingAgent, CommitMessageAgent,
and ValidationAgent for intelligent git workflow automation.

- FileAnalyzerAgent: Analyzes file changes and suggests organization
- GitStagingAgent: Groups related files for logical commits
- CommitMessageAgent: Generates meaningful commit messages
- ValidationAgent: Reviews proposed commits before execution
```

### 4. SHOW PREVIEW & GET CONFIRMATION

Before executing any git commands, show the user:

```
üìã COMMIT PLAN
==============

Commit 1: feat(agents): Add specialized git operation agents
Files:
  - src/agents/git_agents.py (new, 450 lines)
  - src/agents/__init__.py (modified, +3 lines)

Commit 2: feat(workflows): Add git workflow orchestration
Files:
  - src/workflows/git_workflow.py (new, 320 lines)
  - src/workflows/__init__.py (modified, +2 lines)

Commit 3: feat(skills): Add git organizer skill entry point
Files:
  - skills/git_organizer_skill.py (new, 180 lines)
  - skills/README.md (new, 120 lines)

Commit 4: docs: Update CLAUDE.md with git skill documentation
Files:
  - CLAUDE.md (modified, +45 lines)

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: You are on branch 'main'. Consider creating a feature branch.

Push to remote? [origin/main]
```

**Ask the user:** "Proceed with this commit plan? (yes/no)"

### 5. EXECUTE COMMITS

Only after user confirms, execute each commit:

```bash
# For each commit group:

# Stage the files
git add <file1> <file2> <file3>

# Create the commit with message
git commit -m "type(scope): description" -m "body text here"

# Verify commit was created
git log -1 --oneline
```

### 6. PUSH TO REMOTE

After all commits are created:

```bash
# Push to remote
git push origin <current-branch>

# Or if tracking is set up:
git push
```

Show success message:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS
==========
Created 4 commits
Pushed to origin/main
```

## Error Handling

Handle common errors gracefully:

- **No changes to commit**: "Working tree is clean. No changes to commit."
- **Merge conflicts**: "Detected merge conflicts. Please resolve manually."
- **No remote configured**: "No remote repository configured. Add with: git remote add origin <url>"
- **Push rejected**: "Push rejected. Pull latest changes first: git pull --rebase"
- **Untracked files only**: Stage and commit normally
- **Large files detected**: Warn user and ask for confirmation

## Example Usage

When this skill is invoked, you will:
1. Analyze the current git state
2. Categorize all changes
3. Create a logical commit plan
4. Show preview to user
5. Execute commits after confirmation
6. Push to remote

The goal is to create a clean, well-organized commit history that tells a clear story of what changed and why.

## Notes

- Be opinionated about commit organization - group logically, not by file type
- Write descriptive commit messages that explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Learn from the repository's existing commit style
- Always prioritize safety - never commit sensitive data
- Respect the principle: one commit = one logical change
