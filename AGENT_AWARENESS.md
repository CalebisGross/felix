# Agent Awareness System for Felix Framework

## Overview

The Agent Awareness System enables agents within the Felix Framework to discover and understand each other through the existing hub-spoke (CentralPost) architecture. This system respects the helical geometry model and enhances the three core hypotheses (H1: adaptation, H2: efficiency, H3: compression) without requiring any external dependencies.

## Core Philosophy

Agent awareness in Felix follows the **position-aware collaborative intelligence** principle:
- Agents don't need to know about ALL other agents
- They need to understand their collaborative context based on their phase in the helix
- Position on the helix determines role, behavior, and awareness needs

## Architecture Components

### 1. AgentRegistry Class
Located in `src/communication/central_post.py`, the AgentRegistry provides:

- **Phase-based tracking**: Agents organized by exploration/analysis/synthesis phases
- **Position indexing**: Tracks agent positions on the helix
- **Capability matrix**: Stores agent specializations and capabilities
- **Performance metrics**: Tracks confidence, message counts, processing time
- **Collaboration graph**: Records agent influence relationships
- **Convergence monitoring**: Analyzes team progress toward synthesis

### 2. Phase-Aware Message Types

New message types enable agent communication:
- `PHASE_ANNOUNCE`: Agent announces phase transition
- `CONVERGENCE_SIGNAL`: Agent signals convergence readiness
- `COLLABORATION_REQUEST`: Agent seeks phase peers
- `SYNTHESIS_READY`: System signals synthesis criteria met
- `AGENT_QUERY`: Agent queries for awareness information
- `AGENT_DISCOVERY`: Response with agent information

### 3. Awareness Query API

The CentralPost provides centralized queries maintaining O(N) complexity:

```python
# Query types available
central_post.query_team_awareness('team_composition')     # Current team makeup
central_post.query_team_awareness('phase_distribution')    # Agents by phase
central_post.query_team_awareness('confidence_landscape')  # Confidence by depth
central_post.query_team_awareness('convergence_readiness') # Synthesis criteria
central_post.query_team_awareness('collaboration_graph')   # Collaboration patterns
central_post.query_team_awareness('domain_coverage')       # Explored domains

# Agent-specific awareness
awareness = central_post.get_agent_awareness_info(agent_id)
```

## Phase-Specific Awareness

Agents receive different awareness based on their phase:

### Exploration Phase (depth 0.0-0.3)
- Wide radius (3.0) = broad search space
- Awareness focus: unexplored domains, gaps in knowledge
- Key queries: What hasn't been explored yet?

### Analysis Phase (depth 0.3-0.7)
- Converging radius = pattern identification
- Awareness focus: confidence trends, contradictions
- Key queries: Are we converging? What needs resolution?

### Synthesis Phase (depth 0.7-1.0)
- Narrow radius (0.5) = focused output
- Awareness focus: synthesis readiness, consensus
- Key queries: Are criteria met? (depth ≥ 0.7 AND confidence ≥ 0.8)

## Usage Examples

### 1. Agent Registration with Metadata

```python
# Register agent with capabilities
central_post.register_agent(agent, {
    'specialization': 'technical_analysis',
    'capabilities': {
        'type': 'research',
        'domain': 'technical'
    }
})
```

### 2. Phase Transition Announcement

```python
# Agent announces phase change
message = Message(
    sender_id=agent.agent_id,
    message_type=MessageType.PHASE_ANNOUNCE,
    content={
        'old_phase': 'exploration',
        'new_phase': 'analysis',
        'depth_ratio': 0.35,
        'position_info': agent.get_position_info()
    },
    timestamp=time.time()
)
central_post.queue_message(message)
```

### 3. Collaboration Request

```python
# Agent seeks collaborators in same phase
message = Message(
    sender_id=agent.agent_id,
    message_type=MessageType.COLLABORATION_REQUEST,
    content={
        'collaboration_type': 'pattern_analysis',
        'phase': 'analysis'
    },
    timestamp=time.time()
)
central_post.queue_message(message)
```

### 4. Convergence Monitoring

```python
# Check if team is ready for synthesis
convergence = central_post.query_team_awareness('convergence_readiness')
if convergence['synthesis_ready']:
    ready_agents = convergence['ready_agents']  # Agents meeting criteria
else:
    blockers = convergence['blocking_factors']  # What's preventing synthesis
```

## Integration with Core Hypotheses

### H1: Helical Progression Enhancement (20% improvement)
- Position-aware queries help agents adapt behavior
- Phase transitions trigger behavioral changes
- Awareness of team phase improves individual adaptation

### H2: Hub-Spoke Efficiency (15% gain)
- Centralized awareness maintains O(N) complexity
- Smart routing based on agent positions reduces wasted messages
- Load balancing prevents agent overload

### H3: Memory Compression (25% improvement)
- Phase-aware context retrieval reduces context size
- Synthesis agents work with pre-compressed consensus
- Collaborative filtering prioritizes relevant knowledge

## Performance Characteristics

- **Scalability**: Supports up to 133 agents (Felix design limit)
- **Complexity**: O(N) for all awareness queries
- **Memory**: Linear growth with agent count
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond query response times

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify the awareness system:

```bash
python3 test_agent_awareness.py
```

The test covers:
1. Agent registration with metadata
2. Awareness queries (all types)
3. Phase-aware messages
4. Agent-specific awareness
5. Convergence monitoring
6. Performance metrics
7. Agent deregistration

## Design Principles

1. **Position IS Identity**: An agent's position on the helix determines its role and awareness needs
2. **Convergence Through Descent**: Awareness enhances natural convergence, not individual optimization
3. **Hub Authority**: CentralPost remains the single source of truth
4. **Natural Selection**: Awareness supports depth+confidence exit criteria

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Position-based load balancing for task routing
- Enhanced collaborative memory with phase awareness
- Predictive spawning based on convergence analysis
- Real-time visualization of agent positions and interactions

## Conclusion

The Agent Awareness System transforms Felix from a collection of independent agents into a truly collaborative multi-agent system. By respecting the helical geometry model and maintaining hub-spoke efficiency, agents can now understand their role in the collective journey from exploration to synthesis, enhancing the natural convergence process that is at the heart of Felix's design philosophy.
