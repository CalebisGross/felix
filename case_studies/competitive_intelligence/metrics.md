## ROI Calculations - Assumptions & Validation

### Development Time Savings
**Assumptions:**
- Engineering rate: $150/hour (market rate for senior ML engineers)
- LangChain learning curve: 40-80 hours (based on community feedback)
- Infrastructure build time: 200-400 hours (validated against typical agent system projects)
- GUI development: 160-320 hours (standard for multi-panel interface)

**Conservative Estimate:** $70,500 saved
**Aggressive Estimate:** $141,000 saved
**Most Likely:** $100,000 saved

### Operational Savings
**Assumptions:**
- Pinecone vector DB: $0.096/hr standard + compute = $70-$1000/month depending on scale
- LangSmith: $39/user/month documented pricing
- Cloud LLM costs: $10-50/million tokens, enterprises use 10-50M tokens/year

**Annual savings range:** $16,000-$67,000
**Most likely:** $35,000/year

### ROI Calculation Validation
**First-year investment:** $60,000 (licensing + implementation)
**First-year return:** $86,500-$208,000 (time + operational savings)
**Net ROI:** 44%-247%
**Break-even:** 3-8 months

**Validation:** Conservative estimates use lower bounds, aggressive use upper bounds. Most organizations fall in middle of range.

## Market Sizing - Methodology

### Total Addressable Market (TAM): $100B
- **Source:** Enterprise AI software projected at $300B by 2028
- **Multi-agent share:** 33% per Gartner (agentic AI adoption forecast)
- **Calculation:** $300B × 33% = $99B ≈ $100B

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): $1.5B
- **Organizations requiring air-gapped:** ~10,000 globally
  - 2,000 defense prime contractors
  - 8,000 government agencies and labs
  - Healthcare systems with HIPAA requirements
  - Financial institutions with SOX compliance
- **Average deal size:** $150,000 (Professional to Enterprise licenses)
- **Calculation:** 10,000 × $150K = $1.5B

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $15M (1% of SAM in 5 years)
- **Realistic capture:** 100 organizations in 5 years
- **Average deal:** $150K
- **Calculation:** 100 × $150K = $15M
