# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Felix is a Python multi-agent AI framework that uses helical geometry for adaptive agent progression. It models agent behaviors along helical structures (spiral paths) to enable dynamic, scalable AI interactions with continuous evolution and optimization. The framework includes an autonomous knowledge brain system that enables continuous learning from documents through agentic comprehension, knowledge graph construction, and semantic retrieval with meta-learning.

The framework implements three core hypotheses:
- **H1**: Helical progression enhances agent adaptation (20% workload distribution improvement)
- **H2**: Hub-spoke communication optimizes resource allocation (15% efficiency gain)
- **H3**: Memory compression reduces latency (25% attention focus improvement)

## Development Commands

```

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
```bash

python -m src.cli run "Your task here"
python -m src.cli run "Explain quantum computing" --output result.md
python -m src.cli run "Design a REST API" --max-steps 10 --web-search

# Check system status (LLM providers, databases, knowledge stats)
python -m src.cli status

```

The CLI provides full Felix functionality without requiring the GUI, making it ideal for:
- CI/CD integration and automated workflows
- Remote server deployments without display
- Scripting and batch processing
- Quick one-off queries and testing

See [docs/CLI_GUIDE.md](docs/CLI_GUIDE.md) for complete CLI documentation.

### LM Studio Setup (Optional for real LLM integration)
- Start LM Studio server with a loaded model on default port 1234
- The framework will automatically connect when using GUI or setting up LLMAgent with LMStudioClient

## Architecture

### Core Design: Helical Geometry Model
The framework's unique feature is modeling agent progression along a helix (3D spiral):
- **Top radius (3.0)**: Wide exploration phase where agents broadly investigate
- **Bottom radius (0.5)**: Narrow synthesis phase for focused output
- **Height (8.0)**: Total progression depth
- **Turns (2)**: Spiral complexity

Agents move down the helix from exploration to synthesis, with their behavior (temperature, token budget, role) adapting based on position.

### Key Components

     - Tracks which knowledge entries are useful for specific task types
     - Stores usage patterns in `knowledge_usage` table with usefulness scores (0.0-1.0)
     - Boosts retrieval relevance based on historical data (≥3 samples required for reliable boost)
     - Boost factor: 0.5 to 1.0 multiplier based on average usefulness
     - Enables continuous improvement: knowledge that helped similar tasks ranks higher
     - Task-type specific: boosts are context-aware (research tasks vs analysis tasks)
   - **Zero External Dependencies**: Intelligent fallback ensures operation without cloud APIs

8. **Utilities** ([src/utils/](src/utils/))
   - `MarkdownFormatter`: Professional markdown formatting for synthesis results
   - Functions for detailed reports with agent metrics and performance summaries

### Agent Spawn Timing
Agents spawn at different normalized time ranges (0.0-1.0):
- Research: 0.0-0.25 (early exploration)
- Analysis: 0.2-0.6 (mid-phase processing)
- Critic: 0.4-0.7 (continuous validation)

**Note**: Synthesis is no longer an agent type. Final synthesis is performed by CentralPost when confidence threshold (≥0.80) is reached.

Requires LM Studio running before starting Felix system via GUI.

## REST API Interface

The FastAPI REST API ([src/api/](src/api/)) provides programmatic access to Felix functionality:

### Endpoints
- **System Management**: `/api/v1/system/start`, `/stop`, `/status` - Lifecycle control
- **Workflows**: `/api/v1/workflows` - Create, monitor, and list workflows
- **Interactive Docs**: `/docs` - Auto-generated Swagger UI
- **OpenAPI Schema**: `/openapi.json` - API specification

### Features
- API key authentication (optional for development)
- Async workflow execution with background tasks
- Thread pool executor for sync/async bridge
- CORS support for web clients
- Auto-generated documentation

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install API dependencies
pip install -r requirements-api.txt

# Set API key (optional)
export FELIX_API_KEY="your-secret-key"

# Start API server
python3 -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Access docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

See [docs/API_QUICKSTART.md](docs/API_QUICKSTART.md) for detailed usage examples.

## Testing Approach

- `test_felix.py`: Basic import and component tests
- `test_felix_advanced.py`: Integration tests with mock LLM
- `test_agents_integration.py`: Agent spawning and communication tests
- `test_knowledge_brain_system.py`: Comprehensive Knowledge Brain tests (6 tests covering ingestion, comprehension, graph building, retrieval, meta-learning, daemon)

No formal test framework (pytest/unittest) - uses direct script execution.

## Important Notes

1. **Virtual Environment Required**: Always activate `.venv` before running to avoid dependency conflicts

2. **Mock vs Real LLM**: Example workflows use mock LLM by default. For real LLM, ensure LM Studio is running or provide valid OpenAI credentials

3. **Memory Databases**: Auto-created on first run. Located in project root as `*.db` files

4. **Token Budgets**: Configured for local 7B models (~2048 context). Adjust for larger models

5. **Agent Limits**: Default max 10 agents for local systems. Can scale to 133 with sufficient resources

6. **Hypothesis Validation**: Run benchmarks to verify expected gains (H1: 20%, H2: 15%, H3: 25%)

7. **Knowledge Brain System**: Fully optional - zero external dependencies through tiered fallback (LM Studio → TF-IDF → FTS5). Enable via GUI Settings tab. Monitors watch directories, uses agentic comprehension for document understanding, builds knowledge graphs, and provides semantic retrieval with meta-learning. Requires PyPDF2 for PDF support and watchdog for file monitoring (both optional - system adapts if missing)

8. **Custom Agent Plugins**: Felix supports custom agent plugins without modifying core code. Create agent classes inheriting from `LLMAgent` and wrap them in `SpecializedAgentPlugin`. See [docs/PLUGIN_API.md](docs/PLUGIN_API.md) for full documentation and [examples/custom_agents/](examples/custom_agents/) for examples. Plugins are auto-discovered from configured directories and integrate with AgentFactory for dynamic spawning.
